# Push Notification Tester

## How to get this thing running

Register a new Project on Google Developer Console (https://console.developers.google.com). This project has an Id (which is a text you can choose) and a number which needs to be set in app/src/main/res/values/gcm.xml
Then deploy the server part on e.g. Google App Engine and you're all set.
